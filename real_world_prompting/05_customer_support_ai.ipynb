      "source": "## Lesson 5: Customer support prompt\n\nIn this lesson, we'll work on building a customer support chatbot prompt.  Our goal is to build a virtual support bot called \"Acme Assistant\" for a fictional company called Acme Software Solutions.  This fictional company sells a piece of software called AcmeOS, and the chatbot's job is to help answer customer questions around things like installation, error codes, troubleshooting, etc.\n\nTo keep things simple, we will test our prompt through single-turn exchanges, though the prompt should also work well for multi-turn chatbot conversations.\n\nIn the real world, we would likely incorporate RAG as part of this process: we would have a very large database full of relevant customer support information on AcmeOS that we could selectively pull from when answering questions.  \n\nTo keep things simple and more focused on the prompt, we'll use a predefined set of AcmeOS context that we'll pass in to the prompt with every request.\n\nThis is the `context` on AcmeOS our prompt will use:\n",

Here are some of the key takeaways:\n\n* **Structured output:** We implemented a system of XML tags (`\u003cfinal_answer\u003e`) to structure the model's output. \n* **Strict response guidelines:** We created a specific \"objection phrase\" for situations where the assistant shouldn't provide an answer, along with clear conditions for its use. This helps maintain consistent responses for off-topic or inappropriate queries.\n* **Context reference elimination:** We explicitly instructed the assistant not to mention its context or information sources in the final answer, treating the information as common knowledge. This creates a more natural, human-like interaction. \n* **Two-step thinking process:** By separating the thinking stage from the final answer, we allow the assistant to reason about whether it has sufficient information before attempting to answer. This allows us to give the model \"room to think\" but also control what the user sees and prevents unwanted explanations or references to the bot's knowledge base.\n* **Focused scope:** We reinforced the assistant's role as a AcmeOS support bot, ensuring it only answers relevant questions and doesn't attempt to handle unrelated queries.\n\nThese improvements resulted in a more controlled, consistent, and focused customer support assistant that stays within its defined scope of knowledge about AcmeOS.\n\n**Note: While this prompt demonstrates effective techniques for creating a customer support chat prompt, it's important to emphasize that this is not a production-ready chat prompt. It has not been tested on real user inputs or gone through rigorous quality assurance processes or evaluations. In a real-world scenario, extensive testing with diverse user inputs, edge cases, and potential misuse scenarios would be necessary before deploying such a system.**",
