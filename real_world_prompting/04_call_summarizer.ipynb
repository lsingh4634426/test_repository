What we've created is a promising starting point, but it requires extensive testing and evaluation before it can be reliably used in a real-world setting. Our current eye-ball test evaluation has been based on a small set of examples. This is not representative of the diverse and often unpredictable nature of real customer service calls. To ensure the prompt's effectiveness and reliability, we need to implement a comprehensive evaluation process that includes quantitative metrics.  Robust, data-driven evaluations are the key to bridging the gap between a promising prototype and a reliable, production-grade solution."
